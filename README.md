PANDO Protocol

PANDO: Peer Audited Network of Decentralized Organisms

Overview

PANDO is a decentralized asset and trust validation protocol that allows servers (nodes) and clients to securely manage digital asset ownership without relying on central authorities. It emphasizes transparency, verifiability, and collective auditing across independently managed nodes.

Entities

Server (Node): A host that can create (mint), store, and validate assets. Each server has its own private/public key pair.

Client: A user who can own and transfer assets. Clients register their public keys and interact with servers through signed requests.

Asset: A cryptographically signed digital object with an origin server and an owner.

Asset Structure

{
  "asset": {
    "id": "abc",
    "owner_email": "clientA@client.com",
    "origin_email": "serverA@pando.net",
    "data": {
      "seed_str": "...",
      "image_float": 0.25,
      "border_float": 0.5
    }
  },
  "origin_signature": "Signed by origin server",
  "owner_signature": "Signed by current owner"
}

Core Protocol Mechanics

Minting

Only origin servers can mint assets.

Minting rate is throttled based on server uptime and peer validation (see Reputation).

Minting events are committed to a git-style log hashed and signed by peers.

Transfer

Only the current asset owner can initiate a transfer.

Transfers are signed by the owner and require the recipient’s public key.

Transfer events are added to the log and broadcast to peer servers for validation.

Git-Style Log

Every server keeps a git-style log of asset history (creation, transfer).

Each commit is hashed and signed.

Peer servers periodically validate logs and add audit signatures to them.

Peer Auditing and Uptime

Servers cohost verification sessions: e.g., Server A pings Server B hourly and signs session success.

Uptime history determines how many and how often assets can be minted.

Audit logs are shared and cross-validated between trusted servers.

Reputation System

Each server earns reputation based on verified uptime, successful peer audits, and minting consistency.

Asset reputation includes:

Origin server reputation

Peer uptime reputation at time of mint

Older assets naturally carry higher reputational value.

Security Model

Trust Foundations

RSA cryptography ensures non-forgeable signatures.

Origin and owner signatures on assets make tampering immediately detectable.

Git-style logs prevent history rewriting (rebase) attacks.

Vulnerability Mitigation

Forged Asset Creation:

Minting is throttled by uptime and peer validation.

Minting requires multi-server uptime sessions to discourage isolated forgeries.

Exponential growth of required uptime prevents rapid accumulation.

History Rewriting:

Logs are immutable after broadcast; signed commits can't be changed without invalidating peer audits.

Clients and servers can detect inconsistencies and broadcast reports.

Fake Peer Signatures:

RSA-based cryptographic verification prevents forgery of audit signatures.

Sybil Attacks:

Reputation-weighted trust.

Servers gain minting rights only through public uptime logs and audits.

Minting quotas increase exponentially to discourage spam and collusion.

Client Rogue Actions:

Clients have no authority over asset metadata or minting.

All interactions are signed and verified by origin servers.

Server Collusion:

Logs and audits are public.

Clients can detect collusion through third-party audit logs.

Flag/report system can isolate dishonest servers.

DoS Attacks (Commit Spam):

Minting and transfer rates are bound by server uptime and peer validation.

Commit flood is mitigated by rate limits and invalidation of unaudited histories.

Non-Cooperating Nodes:

The network adapts by forming clusters of cooperative nodes.

Servers can opt to reject data from flagged or blacklisted peers.

Naming and Philosophy

Inspired by Pando, the ancient clonal colony of a single organism that has survived through interconnectivity and collective resilience. PANDO embodies organic decentralization—each node independent but stronger together.

PANDO is not just a protocol; it's a decentralized organism of trust, built to outlive the storms of centralization, greed, and manipulation.
